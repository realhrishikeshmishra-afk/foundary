# Testing Meeting Flow - Quick Guide

## 🧪 How to Test the Meeting System

### Step 1: Create a Test Booking

1. **Go to Booking Page**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/booking
   ```

2. **Fill out the form:**
   - Select a consultant
   - Choose a date (today or tomorrow)
   - Choose a time (set it to current time + 10 minutes for testing)
   - Select duration (30 or 60 minutes)
   - Fill in your details
   - Add a message (optional)

3. **Submit the form**
   - You'll see the payment modal
   - You can close it (don't need to pay for testing)

### Step 2: Approve the Booking (NEW TESTING FEATURE!)

1. **Go to My Bookings**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/my-bookings
   ```

2. **Find your pending booking**
   - It will show "Payment incomplete" badge
   - You'll see three buttons:
     - "Complete Payment" (normal flow)
     - **"Approve (Test)"** ← NEW TESTING BUTTON
     - "Cancel"

3. **Click "Approve (Test)" button**
   - This will:
     - ✅ Mark payment as "paid"
     - ✅ Mark status as "confirmed"
     - ✅ Generate meeting room ID: `foundarly-{bookingId}`
   - Toast notification: "Booking approved! Meeting room created."

## 📝 Testing Notes

### What the "Approve (Test)" Button Does:

```typescript
// Updates booking with:
{
  payment_status: "paid",
  status: "confirmed",
  meeting_room_id: `foundarly-${bookingId}`
}
```

This simulates what happens after successful Razorpay payment, allowing you to test the meeting flow without actual payment processing.
