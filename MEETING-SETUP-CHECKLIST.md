### 3. Booking Confirmation Flow
When booking is confirmed, ensure:
```typescript
// In payment success handler:
await bookingsService.update(bookingId, {
  status: "confirmed",

  meeting_room_id: `foundarly-${bookingId}`
});

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Build & Deploy Frontend
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist folder to your hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
```

### 2. Update Redirects
Ensure your hosting handles SPA routing:

**Netlify** (`netlify.toml`):
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**Vercel** (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

### 3. Test Production
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Test meeting flow end-to-end
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify Jitsi loads correctly
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Metrics to Track
- Meeting join rate (% of bookings that join)
- Average call duration
- Technical issues reported
- User satisfaction (from reviews)
- Browser/device breakdown

### Error Monitoring
Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry):
```typescript
// In Meeting.tsx, wrap critical sections:
try {
  await startCall();
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
  toast.error("Failed to start call");
}
```

- [ ] Test on tablets

## 🎨 Branding Customization

Update these values in `Meeting.tsx`:
```typescript
// Line ~120: Jitsi config
interfaceConfigOverwrite: {
  APP_NAME: "Your Brand Name",  // Change this
  DEFAULT_BACKGROUND: "#yourcolor",  // Your theme
}
```

Update logo in top bar:
