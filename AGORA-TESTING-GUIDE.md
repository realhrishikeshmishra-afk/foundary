# Agora Video Call Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create Test Booking

1. Login as a user
2. Go to Consultants page

### 3. Test Video Call

#### Option A: Two Browser Windows (Same Computer)

## Browser Console Logs

### Successful Join
```
=== START CALL FUNCTION CALLED ===
Booking: {id: "...", ...}
Joining Agora channel: foundarly-xxxxx
Successfully joined channel
Playing local video
Connected to video call!
```

### Remote User Joins
```

### Errors to Watch For
```
❌ "Failed to join channel" → Check App ID in .env
❌ "Failed to initialize Agora client" → SDK not installed
❌ "Permission denied" → User blocked camera/mic
❌ "Network error" → Check internet connection
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Video service not configured"
**Solution**: Check `.env` file has `VITE_AGORA_APP_ID`

### Issue: "Failed to join channel"
**Solutions**:
1. Verify App ID is correct: `d5eaf592322846eab2879d2bc086af78`
2. Check Agora Console for account status
3. Verify SDK is installed: `npm list agora-rtc-sdk-ng`

### Issue: No video/audio
**Solutions**:
1. Check browser permissions (camera/mic)
2. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
3. Check device not in use by another app
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Cannot see remote user
**Solutions**:
1. Verify both users in same channel (same meeting ID)
2. Check both users clicked "Join Video Call"
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for connection
4. Check browser console for subscription errors
5. Refresh both tabs

### Issue: Poor video quality
**Solutions**:
1. Check network speed (need 1+ Mbps)
2. Close other bandwidth-heavy apps
3. Move closer to WiFi router
4. Try wired connection

### Issue: Echo or feedback
**Solutions**:
1. Use headphones
2. Mute when not speaking
3. Don't have both tabs on same device with audio

- CPU usage: < 50%
- Memory usage: < 200MB

### Check Agora Console
1. Go to: https://console.agora.io
2. Login with your account
3. Check "Usage" for:
   - Active channels
   - Minutes used
   - Quality metrics
   - Error rates

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works ✅
1. Test with real users
2. Monitor Agora Console for usage
3. Plan for token authentication (production)
4. Consider adding features:
   - Screen sharing
   - Recording
   - Virtual backgrounds
   - Beauty filters

### If Issues Found ❌
1. Check browser console logs
2. Check Agora Console for errors
3. Review `AGORA-MIGRATION-COMPLETE.md`
4. Check `AGORA-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
5. Test with Agora demo app to isolate issue

## Production Readiness

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Token authentication implemented
- [ ] Error handling robust
- [ ] Analytics/monitoring set up
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Mobile testing completed
- [ ] Browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms in place
- [ ] Usage limits monitored

### Token Authentication (Required)
Currently using App ID only (works for testing). For production:
1. Create token generation endpoint
2. Generate tokens server-side
3. Pass token to `agoraService.join()`

See `AGORA-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` for details.
