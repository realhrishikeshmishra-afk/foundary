## Testing the System:

1. **Make a Test Booking:**
   - Go to booking page
   - Select consultant
   - Complete payment (or use test approval)

2. **Admin Approves:**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to Manage Bookings
   - Click "Approve (Test)" or Edit booking
   - Set status to "Confirmed"

3. **Check Meeting Link:**
   - Meeting room ID appears in table
   - Click copy button to copy link
   - Click open button to test meeting
   - Check emails for confirmation

4. **Join Meeting:**
   - Use copied link or email link
   - Both user and consultant can join
   - Meeting works with open access

## Important Notes:

⚠️ **Consultant Assignment** - Admin manually coordinates with consultants
⚠️ **No Consultant Login** - Consultants don't need platform accounts
⚠️ **Email Delivery** - Ensure Resend API is configured
⚠️ **Meeting Access** - Anyone with link can join (like Zoom/Google Meet)

## Future Considerations:

If you want to add back consultant features later:
- Consultant dashboard can be re-enabled
- Payout system can be restored
- Role-based access can be implemented
- Just uncomment the routes and sidebar items

## Support:

For any issues:
1. Check Admin Bookings page for meeting links
2. Verify email system is working (check Resend dashboard)
3. Test meeting links before sharing
4. Ensure booking status is "confirmed" for meeting access
