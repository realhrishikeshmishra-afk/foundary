## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations
You need to run these SQL files in order:
1. `database/consultant-earnings-system.sql` (if not already run)
2. `database/consultant-role-setup.sql`

### Step 2: Link Existing Consultants
For any existing consultants, you need to:
1. Go to Admin → Manage Consultants
2. Edit each consultant
3. Add their email address
4. If they have an existing user account, add their user_id
5. Save - this will automatically set their role to "consultant"

### Step 3: Test Access Control
1. Login as a consultant user
2. Navigate to `/consultant-dashboard`
3. Should see dashboard if properly linked
4. Should see access denied if not linked

## 🚀 Next Steps

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Link at least one consultant to a user account
- [ ] Test consultant dashboard access (should work)
- [ ] Test non-consultant access (should be denied)
- [ ] Test admin consultant management interface

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If consultant can't access dashboard:
1. Check if they have "consultant" role in profiles table
2. Check if they're linked to an active consultant record
3. Check if consultant record has `is_active = true`

### If role isn't being set automatically:
1. Ensure `database/consultant-role-setup.sql` has been run
2. Check if triggers are working properly
3. Manually update role via admin interface

The consultant role system is now complete and ready for deployment!
