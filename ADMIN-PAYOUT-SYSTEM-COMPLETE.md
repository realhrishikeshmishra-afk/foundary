SET email = u.email
FROM auth.users u
WHERE c.user_id = u.id

VALUES ('Test Consultant', 'Test', 'Testing', ARRAY['Test'], 1000, 1800, 'test@consultant.com', auth.uid(), true)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;

-- Create test payout request
INSERT INTO payout_requests (
  consultant_id,
  amount,
  payment_method,
  payment_details,
  status
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM consultants WHERE email = 'test@consultant.com'),

## Common Admin Tasks

### Bulk Operations
```sql
-- Approve all pending requests under $1000
UPDATE payout_requests 
SET status = 'approved', processed_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'pending' AND amount <= 100000;

-- Reject old pending requests (30+ days)
UPDATE payout_requests 
SET status = 'rejected', 
    admin_notes = 'Auto-rejected: Request too old',
    processed_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'pending' 
AND requested_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Reports
```sql
-- Monthly payout summary
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', requested_at) as month,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as requests,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM payout_requests
WHERE requested_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY month, status
ORDER BY month DESC, status;

-- Top consultants by payout amount
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.email,
  COUNT(pr.id) as total_requests,
  SUM(pr.amount) as total_amount
FROM consultants c
JOIN payout_requests pr ON c.id = pr.consultant_id
WHERE pr.status = 'paid'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Payout Requests" Link Not Showing
**Solution**: Check if user has admin role
```sql
SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### No Payout Requests Showing
**Solution**: Create test data or check RLS policies
```sql
-- Check if requests exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payout_requests;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM payout_requests; -- Should work for admin
```

### Email Constraint Errors
**Solution**: Ensure unique emails
```sql
-- Find duplicate emails
SELECT email, COUNT(*) 
FROM consultants 
WHERE email IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Fix duplicates
UPDATE consultants 
SET email = email || '-' || id::text 
WHERE email IN (SELECT email FROM consultants GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
```
