## Setup Instructions

## How It Works

### Earnings Flow
```
1. User books session → Payment collected
2. Session completed → Trigger earnings calculation
3. Calculate: Total - 15% platform fee = Consultant earnings
4. Create entry in consultant_earnings table
5. Update booking with consultant_earnings and payout_status
6. Consultant sees pending earnings in dashboard
7. Consultant requests payout
8. Admin approves and processes
9. Mark as paid
```

### Reschedule Flow
```
User/Consultant Side:
1. Click "Reschedule" button
2. Enter reason and proposed new date/time
3. Submit request
4. Status: "reschedule_requested"

Other Party Side:
1. See reschedule request notification
2. Review reason and proposed time
3. Approve or reject
4. If approved: Booking date/time updated
5. If rejected: Original date/time remains
```

## Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Consultants can only view their own data
- Users can only view their own bookings
- Admins can view all data
- Payout requests protected by consultant ownership

### Access Control
- Consultant dashboard requires consultant role
- Payout requests require pending earnings

## Platform Fee Configuration

Currently set to 15% (configurable in database function):

```sql
platform_fee_percent DECIMAL(5,2) := 0.15; -- 15% platform fee
```

To change:
1. Update `calculate_consultant_earnings()` function
2. Modify the `platform_fee_percent` variable
